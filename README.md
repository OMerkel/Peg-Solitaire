A <b>Peg Solitaire</b> with various popular board shapes.
The mind bending puzzle of Peg Solitaire is well-known using
different board shapes and different amount of holes for
placing the pegs. The common mechanics is that a selected
peg is capable to jump any directly adjacent single neighbour
in straight direction onto a free position. A peg is removed
as it gets jumped. The selected peg will end its move just on
the first free field behind the peg that gets removed then.

Supported board shapes include

* triangular 15 peg positions (also called triangular 5),
* triangular 21 peg positions (also called triangular 6),
* English board, and
* French board.

In this <b>Peg Solitaire</b> you first select one of the board positions
to be a single vacancy as a starting position.

By jumping the total number of pegs is reduced one by one then until a
single peg is remaining. This class of challenges are referred to as
<em>single vacancy to single survivor challenges</em>. All possible
starting positions of a <em>15 hole triangular board shape</em> do
definitively allow to finally end up with just one peg remaining on
optimal strategy.

If the single vacancy position matches the position of the survivor
these challenges are called a <em>complement challenge</em>. As a
tough task you might find out which vacancies do not allow a
complement challenge.

Consecutive jumps with same peg could be performed depending on the
board situation obviously. Such chained jumps could be seen as a
single move. The question arises to find the best solutions with
minimum amount of moves then.

Feel free to find all possible solutions for these different kind of challenges.
